Twitter clone developed with Soul Network as the authentication and identity provider.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsoul-project%2Ftwitter-clone%2Ftree%2Fmain&env=SOUL_PLATFORM_ID,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_URL,DB_NAME)

## Running locally

1. Create an account on Soul by visiting https://login.soul-network.com/register
2. Login through https://www.soul-network.com/ using your new account and retrieve the access token
3. Create a new platform using your account (please replace the placeholders with your desired values)

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.soul-network.com/v1/platforms' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "<PLATFORM_NAME>",
    "redirect_uris": ["<VALID_CALLBACK_URL>"]
}'
```

4. Information about your platform will be returned, including a unique identifier represented by
the `id` field

5. Make a copy of `.env.development` and call it `.env.development.local`, `SOUL_PLATFORM_ID` should be
set to the `id` you've obtained on the step above

6. Run the application!

```shell
$ nvm use
$ npm -g install npm@8

$ npm run dev
```
